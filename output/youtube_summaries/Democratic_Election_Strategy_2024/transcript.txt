OR THE QUESTION IS, DO WE WANT TO GO BACK? THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. NONE OF THEM ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT. PETE BUTTIGIEG IS APPEARING IN HIS PERSONAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN HIS OFFICIAL ROLE, I'M AWKWARDLY NOT GOING TO CALL YOU MR. SECRETARY OR MAYOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH ME TODAY. >> I PLAYED THAT CLIP OF DONALD TRUMP SAYING IN FOUR YEARS, YOU WON'T HAVE TO VOTE AGAIN. HE HAS MADE SIMILAR STATEMENTS BEFORE. CHRIS SUNUNU WAS ON AFTER YOU, AND HE SAID IT IS CLASSIC TRUMPISM. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT. >> I DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS. THAT'S YET ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T GET RE-ELECTED. I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO, THERE WERE SOME COMMENTATORS WHO SOUNDED CLEVER BY SAYING, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM WITH DEMOCRATS IS WE WERE TAKING TRUMP LITERALLY WHEN WE SHOULD'VE TAKEN THEM SERIOUSLY, AND THE SMART PEOPLE WERE TAKING THEM SERIOUSLY INSTEAD OF TAKING HIM LITERALLY. WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OR SOMETHING LIKE WANTING A POLITICAL OPPONENT LIKE LIZ CHENEY, A CONGRESSWOMAN WHO CRITICIZED HIM, TO BE TRIED IN A TELEVISED MILITARY TRIBUNAL, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TAKE THAT LITERALLY OR SERIOUSLY. EITHER WAY, IT'S BAD NEWS. >> I WANT TO ELIMINATE A SYSTEM SIMILAR HISTORY VOTE AGAIN, THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM. THIS IS THE AWKWARD QUESTION YOU BEEN ANSWERING 1 MILLION TIMES. I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO TELL ME THE PROCESS OF THE VETTING PROCESS, THAT I DO WANT TO KNOW -- YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT YOURSELF. YOU KNOW KAMALA HARRIS, YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN, YOU BEEN AROUND THE SYSTEM. WHAT KIND OF QUALITIES DO YOU THINK WOULD BEST COMPLEMENT HER? >> IT'S HER CALL AND SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE IS DOING. THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY BENCH OF LEADERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ALL OF WHOM ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THE TOP OF OUR TICKET, AND HE KNOWS WHAT THE EXACT FLYING FORMATION IS GOING TO BE LIKE. HOWEVER THAT SHAKES OUT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE PULLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND A PARTY THAT, LET'S FACE IT, IS NOT ALWAYS KNOWN FOR BEING EXTREMELY QUICK TO FALL IN LINE, AS THEY SAY. THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN REMARKABLE ABOUT THE LAST WEEK. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S ONLY BEEN A WEEK. IT'S HOW QUICKLY SHE COALESCED OUR FAVORITES ACROSS ALL OF ITS DIFFERENT CORNERS TO COME TOGETHER AND RALLIED TO THE CAUSE OF MAKING SURE SHE IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT. >> I ALSO THINK THIS PROCESS OF HAVING SO MANY DEMOCRATS OUT IS JOYFUL, WHICH REMINDS PEOPLE OF HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE GET INTO POLITICS FOR GOOD REASON. REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WALKED YOU ON FOX NEWS THIS MORNING WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU ON THE DEBATE STAGE WITH KATIE VANCE. YOU HAVE WATCHED HIM, YOU COMMENTED ON HIM. WHAT WOULD YOU LOVE TO DEBATE HIM ABOUT? WHAT TOPICS WOULD YOU LOVE TO DISCUSS WITH HIM? >> WHERE DO YOU START? YOU KNOW, THEY SELECTED SOMEBODY WHO IS REALLY REMINDED MANY AMERICANS OF WHY THEY ARE OFF PUT BY THE TURN THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TAKEN IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. IT'S NOT JUST THAT HE SAID A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE WEIRD, OR INSULTING, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS CHILDISH CAT LADIES.
IT'S ALSO THAT HE SEEMS TO VIEW IT'S ALSO THAT HE SEEMS TO VIEW EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF THE NEGATIVE. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, FOR EXAMPLE, THIS THING ABOUT HAVING CHILDREN, I THINK A LOT OF US WITHOUT KIDS WOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT THAT EXPERIENCE OPENS YOU TO A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THE WORLD. BUT HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT IN THOSE TERMS. HE TALKS ABOUT HOW ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE KIDS IS LESS THAN, THAT THEIR PERSPECTIVES HAVE LESS VALUE, WHICH IS JUST A REALLY STRANGE TAKE. IT IS NOT JUST A WEIRD STYLE THAT HE BRINGS. IT IS THAT THIS LEADS TO WEIRD POLICIES, LIKE HIS PROPOSAL THAT THE NUMBER OF VOTES YOU GET IN AN ELECTION WOULD BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON HOW MANY KIDS YOU HAVE. I MEAN, I WOULD THINK ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE WAS A PRETTY BASIC, UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE ARE SO MANY STRANGE POLICY COMMITMENTS THAT HE HAS. I GUESS WHAT I WOULD MOST WANT TO SEE IN THIS DEBATE, WHOEVER IS AT THE TABLE WITH HIM, IS GETTING INTO THAT RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN A STRANGE WORLDVIEW AND BETWEEN A STRANGE WORLDVIEW AND A STRANGE SET OF POLICIES. LET'S ALSO REMEMBER HIS RELATIONSHIP TO PROJECT 2025. IT'S KIND OF AMAZING THEY PUT ALL THE STUFF OUT THERE. I THINK IT IS ALSO TELLING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I CAN REMEMBER THAT A COMPETENCY POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR A POLITICAL PARTY HAS BEEN SO PROFOUNDLY UNPOPULAR THAT THE PRESIDENT, THE CANDIDATE OF THAT PARTY, HAS TO PRETEND HE'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT IS DEFINITELY THE ROAD MAP FOR A FUTURE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. JD VANCE, HAVING HIM ON THE TICKET BASICALLY CERTIFIES THAT FACT.
JD VANCE WROTE THE FORWARD TO JD VANCE WROTE THE FORWARD TO THE FORTHCOMING BOOK BY THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION PRESIDENT. IT'S THE INSTITUTIONAL HOUMA PROJECT 2025, WHICH MEANS IT IS BASICALLY PROJECT 2025, THE BOOK. IT COULDN'T BE MORE ON THE NOSE IN TERMS OF REVEALING WHERE A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WOULD TAKE THIS COUNTRY AS KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SO EFFECTIVELY. WHERE WOULD TAKE US IS BACKWARDS. >> HE HAD A SMILE ACROSS HIS FACE WHEN JD VANCE WAS NAMED. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT MESSAGING. YOU ARE A DEEPLY SUBSTANTIVE KIND OF GUY. YOU ARE ALSO GOOD AT SPEAKING IN ACCESSIBLE LANGUAGE. YOU JUST MENTIONED STRANGE, WEIRD. WE HAVE SEEN THE VICE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS USE WEIRD. THIS IS KIND OF AN EVOLUTION A LITTLE BIT IN MESSAGING OVER THE PAST, WHICH I THINK IS GOOD AND EFFECTIVE. WHY DO YOU THINK SPEAKING ABOUT TRUMP AND VANCE AND THE THREAT IN THAT LANGUAGE WORKS? >> I THINK IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATS VERSUS REPUBLICANS DEBATE OR ARGUMENT. WE COULD GO BACK AND FORTH ALL DAY ON A MORE PROGRESSIVE WORLDVIEW VERSUS THE MORE CONSERVATIVE WORLDVIEW. BUT THE STUFF THAT YOU ARE SEEING OUT OF TRUMP AND VANCE ISN'T JUST CONSERVATIVE. IN FACT, SOMETIMES IT IS AS OFFENSIVE TO CONSERVATIVE IDEAS AS IT IS TOO LIBERAL IDEAS.
THIS TALK OF TERMINATING THE THIS TALK OF TERMINATING THE CONSTITUTION, HAVING SOMEBODY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES RAMBLING ABOUT ELECTROCUTING SHARKS AND HANNIBAL LECTOR. I THINK IT REMINDS US OF THE CHOICE WE FACE, NOT JUST IN TERMS OF POLICIES AND DIRECTION FOR THE COUNTRY, WHICH IS HUGE OF COURSE, BUT ALSO A CHOICE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. I DON'T WANT TO WORRY ABOUT SHARKS. OR THINK ABOUT HANNIBAL LECTOR. ANY OF THOSE KIND OF DARK AND TWISTED THINGS THAT WERE KIND OF SHOVED IN HER FACE ALL OF THE TIME DURING THE TRUMP RESIDENCE THE AND EVER SINCE BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BE A BETTER, BRIGHTER FUTURE. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS CONTRAST. DON'T GET ME WRONG. WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST IN THE GRAVITY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS OUR ECONOMY IF THERE IS A CHANCE FOR TRUMP TO RETURN TO POWER. WHICH IS A HIGH-CLASS PROBLEM IN WAVES. THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT FREEDOM, HARRIS HAS QUICKLY MADE HER CAMPAIGN ABOUT FREEDOM. BEYONCE OF ALL PEOPLE TOLD HER SHE COULD USE THE SONG READ HIM. THAT'S A GOOD GET. I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS COULD KIND OF RECLAIM THIS FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. SHE IS STARTING TO. HOW COULD THEY RECLAIM THE MANTLE FROM REPUBLICANS? >> THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE BELIEVED IN FOR A LONG TIME, GOING BACK TO WHEN I WAS RUNNING. I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TALK MORE IN TERMS OF FREEDOM. YES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE FREE FROM OVERBEARING GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS THE THING THAT CONSERVATIVES HAVE TRADITIONALLY TALKED ABOUT THE MOST. IT ALSO, GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT CAN MAKE YOU UNFREE. GOOD GOVERNMENT HELPS MAKE SURE YOU ARE FREE FROM OTHER THREATS TO YOUR WELL-BEING. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MADE PEOPLE MORE FREE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE IN FEAR OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HAD A MEDICAL EVENT. IT IS IMPORTANT, I THINK, TO KEEP PEOPLE FREE FROM FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE, WHICH IS WHY WE ARE THE ONES OUT THERE SAYING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT OUR KIDS ISN'T TO BAN A BUNCH OF BOOKS, IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS AREN'T FINDING THEIR WAY INTO NEIGHBORHOODS, OR GOD FORBID, SCHOOLS. AND THERE IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY NOW I THINK TO EMBRACE THAT EVEN FURTHER BECAUSE TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS WALKED AWAY FROM FREEDOM. AGAIN, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MILITARY TRIBUNALS FOR MILITARY OPPONENTS, YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS TALKING ABOUT FREEDOM. YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS LETTING A WORD LIKE LIBERTY ESCAPE YOUR LIPS. AND SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY SMART THING TO DO. I THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY IT MAKES SENSE. IT'S WHO WE ARE AND IT'S WHO SHE IS. BUT ALSO, IT CAN APPEAL TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK A LOT OF INDEPENDENCE, A LOT OF WHAT I LIKE TO GO FUTURE AND FORMER REPUBLICANS, CONTINUE TO SINCERELY CARE ABOUT. AND ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED THAT IT IS AT RISK. AND OF COURSE, IT IS A WOMEN'S FREEDOM TO CHOOSE AND ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE. A FREEDOM THAT DONALD TRUMP WITHDREW WHEN HE DESTROYED THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IN THIS COUNTRY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE NOT JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THAT HAPPENED, BUT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A TRUMP/VANCE TICKET AND A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE FREEDOM TO GROW YOUR FAMILY THROUGH IVF. THEY DO NOT SUPPORT A LOT OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS. ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION, THEY DON'T EVEN SUPPORT MY FREEDOM TO MARRY, GOING BY HOW MOST REPUBLICANS VOTED WHEN THAT WAS ON THE FLOOR. I THINK IT IS A POWERFUL FRAMEWORK. I THINK YES, IT HAS WORKED FOR THE CAMPAIGN, BUT IT IS ALSO JUST FITTING. >> YEAH. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE FRAMING WITH THE OTHER SIDE. I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY -- YOU BEEN ASKED 1000 TIMES ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE, ALL THOSE THINGS. I KNOW FROM WORKING WITH A LOT OF POLITICIANS, YOU TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS WITH YOUR FAMILY AND YOU CONSIDER A LOT OF THINGS. YOU HAVE A LOT OF KIDS, YOU HAVE A HAPPY MARRIAGE. YOU ARE YOUNG, EULA POLICY, YOU LOVE POLITICS. YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT YOU WANT IN THE FUTURE? >> ANY DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT IS A FAMILY DECISION.
I GOT INTO POLITICS AS A YOUNG, I GOT INTO POLITICS AS A YOUNG, SINGLE MAYOR. >> IT'S DIFFERENT NOW. >> IT REALLY IS. I SAW PEOPLE SAY THAT ON TV WHO HAD FAMILIES, BUT I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. NOW I DO. THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE SACRIFICES THAT MY HUSBAND MAKES, THAT OUR CHILDREN MAKE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE 3. THEY MAY NOT KNOW IT, BUT THEY ARE HELPING TO MAKE IT
POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SERVE. POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SERVE. AND THAT IS A REALLY BIG DEAL, AND A HEAVY THING, AND NOT SOMETHING TO BE DONE LIGHTLY. AND OF COURSE, IT WORKS BOTH WAYS. ANYTIME YOU CONSIDER A DEMANDING JOB, CERTAINLY A DEMANDING ROLE IN POLITICS, YOU THINK TWICE ABOUT IT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A COST. ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVING KIDS AND HAVING A FAMILY HAS HELPED ME TO BETTER APPRECIATE WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I THINK ABOUT, AGAIN, THE SIMPLE FACT THAT OUR MARRIAGE AND FAMILY, THIS MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE, EXISTS DUE TO A SINGLE VOTE ON THE SUPREME COURT. OUR KIDS COME I HOPE AND EXPECT, WILL BE AROUND FOR THE 22nd CENTURY. AND SO IF I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE GOOD DECISIONS AND ELECT GOOD LEADERS AND REINFORCE WHAT IS BEST ABOUT THIS COUNTRY GOING INTO THE BALANCE OF THE CENTURY SO THAT IT GOES WELL ALL THE WAY INTO THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GOING TO BE HOLDING US ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT. THEY ARE NOT QUITE 3. I'M ALREADY AT THE STAGE OF WHY? I GOT FOUR OR FIVE LIES BEFORE I'M OUT OF ANSWERS. THE MOST BASIC QUESTION, WHY? SOON, THOSE QUESTIONS WILL EVOLVE INTO DEEPER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE, WHO ARE IN POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT NOW, HAVE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SAFER FROM GUN VIOLENCE, TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GROW INTO AN ECONOMY THAT IS FAIR AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GROW UP INTO A CLIMATE THAT SUPPORTS AND SUSTAINS THEIR WELL-BEING. TO ME NOW, WE TALK ABOUT GOOD CLIMATE CHOICES. IT'S NOT ABOUT SAVING SOME ABSTRACT THING CALLED THE PLANET. IT'S ABOUT THEM MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE PERSONALLY AND MATERIALLY BETTER OFF.
