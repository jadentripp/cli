This document is a set of instructions about how to use the GPT-4o-mini model to generate text.

let's start with a simple {text} input to the model for our first request. We'll use both `system` and `user` messages for our first request, and we'll receive a response from the `assistant` role.

from openai import OpenAI 
import os

## Set the API key and model name
MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as an env var>"))
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=MODEL,
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Help me with my math homework!"}, # <-- This is the system message that provides context to the model
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello! Could you solve 2+2?"}  # <-- This is the user message for which the model will generate a response
  ]
)

print("Assistant: " + completion.choices[0].message.content)

Assistant: Of course! \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

API
The easiest way to get a transcript for a given video is to execute:

from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)
Note: By default, this will try to access the English transcript of the video. If your video has a different language, or you are interested in fetching a different language's transcript, please read the section below.

This will return a list of dictionaries looking somewhat like this:

[
    {
        'text': 'Hey there',
        'start': 7.58,
        'duration': 6.13
    },
    {
        'text': 'how are you',
        'start': 14.08,
        'duration': 7.58
    },
    # ...
]
